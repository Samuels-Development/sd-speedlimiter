# sd-speedlimiter

`sd-speedlimiter` is a lightweight script that enables players to set a speed limit for their vehicles, measured in km/h. Unlike other cruise control or speed limiter scripts that forcibly adjust vehicle speedâ€”often leading to unpredictable handling and making the vehicle difficult to controlâ€”this script takes a more efficient approach. It simply disables the acceleration key when the speed limit is reached, ensuring smooth and natural vehicle behavior without negatively affecting performance or usability.

`/speedlimiter`: Activates the speed limiter, capping the speed at your current vehicle speed. Default keybind: M.
`/speedlimiter [value]`: Activates the speed limiter with a specified speed limit (e.g., /speedlimiter 50 caps the speed at 50 km/h). Default keybind: M.
`/speedLimiterUp`: Increases the speed limit by a small increment. Default keybind: , (COMMA).
`/speedLimiterDown`: Decreases the speed limit by a small increment. Default keybind: . (PERIOD).
